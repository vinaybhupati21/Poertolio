About Me
With over 5 years of hands-on experience, I am a dedicated and results-oriented data professional. My expertise spans the full spectrum of MS SQL Server administration—from installation and high-availability configuration to performance tuning and 24/7 support. I thrive on ensuring data integrity, security, and optimal performance for critical systems.

Beyond my DBA role, I am passionate about leveraging data to drive business growth. As a Qlik Analyst, I develop end-to-end reporting solutions, provide daily business intelligence updates, and contribute strategic ideas based on data-driven insights. My experience with Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting further bridges the gap between raw data and immediate, actionable intelligence. I am always eager to tackle new challenges and expand my skills, which has led me to gain experience with MongoDB.
